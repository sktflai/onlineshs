        explanation: "Vertical parabola: (x - h)² = 4p(y - k)."

        question: "In a parabola, the focus is located at a distance p from the vertex along the:",
        options: ["Directrix", "Axis of symmetry", "Latus rectum", "Asymptote"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "p is the distance from vertex to focus along the axis of symmetry."

        question: "For the ellipse x²/16 + y²/9 = 1, what is the length of the major axis?",
        options: ["6", "8", "10", "4"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "a² = 16 → a = 4, major axis length = 2a = 8."
