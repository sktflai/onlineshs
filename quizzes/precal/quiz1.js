        question: "Which conic section is formed when the plane is perpendicular to the cone axis?",
        options: ["Parabola", "Ellipse", "Circle", "Hyperbola"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "A circle is formed when the plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cone."
    },
    {
        question: "The standard equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is:",
        options: ["(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²", "(x - h)² - (y - k)² = r²", "(x - h)² = 4p(y - k)", "x²/a² + y²/b² = 1"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "This is the standard form for a circle centered at (h, k)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the radius of the circle x² + y² - 6x + 8y = 0 after completing the square?",
        options: ["5", "3", "4", "√25"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Complete the square: (x - 3)² + (y + 4)² = 25 → radius = 5."

    {
        question: "The eccentricity of a circle is:",
        options: ["1", "0", ">1", "<1 but >0"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A circle has eccentricity e = 0, as it is the 'roundest' conic."
    },
    {
        question: "Which conic has e = 1?",
        options: ["Circle", "Ellipse", "Parabola", "Hyperbola"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Parabola has eccentricity exactly 1."
    },
    {
        question: "The general equation Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 represents a circle when:",
        options: ["B = 0 and A = C", "B ≠ 0", "A ≠ C", "B² - 4AC > 0"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "For a circle, coefficients of x² and y² are equal and no xy term."
    },
    {
        question: "Find the center of the circle (x + 1)² + (y - 5)² = 16.",
        options: ["(1, 5)", "(-1, 5)", "(1, -5)", "(-1, -5)"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Standard form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², so center (-1, 5)."

    {
        question: "A circle has diameter endpoints at (0,0) and (6,8). What is the radius?",
        options: ["5", "10", "√50", "√25"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Distance between endpoints = diameter = 10, radius = 5."

        question: "Which conic is formed when the plane is parallel to the generator of the cone?",
        options: ["Circle", "Ellipse", "Parabola", "Hyperbola"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Parabola is formed when the plane is parallel to the generator."

        question: "The equation x² + y² = 25 represents a circle with radius:",
        options: ["5", "25", "10", "√25"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "r² = 25 → r = 5."
